Welcome to Metafy. Please familiarize yourself with our community guidelines, as they are essential for creating a positive and enjoyable experience for all members.

## Be Kind
Respect and civility are paramount: hate speech, harassment, threats, and sharing personal information are strictly prohibited and may result in immediate bans.

## Quality, Relevance, and Originality Standards
All posts should relate to gaming or gaming culture. Check for similar content before posting to avoid creating duplicates. Repetitive, low-effort, or low-quality posts may be removed at moderator discretion.

## Explicit Content
No explicit or violent content, including gore, pornography, and animal cruelty.

## Misinformation & Sensationalist Content
Refrain from posting misinformation, clickbait, and sensationalist content. Impersonating users or public figures with the intent to mislead others is not allowed.

## Self-Promotion & Engagement Farming
Posts intended solely for soliciting follows, comments, reactions, or engagement for self-promotion or XP farming are not allowed. Personal promotion and advertising must be limited to your Profile Feed and the Metafy Marketplace. Refrain from using affiliate links, URL shorteners, promoting cryptocurrencies, posting job listings, or requesting free items.

## Unethical Gaming Practices
Engaging in the sharing, facilitation, or promotion of piracy, hacking, cheating, or advocating the circumvention of terms of service is forbidden and will lead to an immediate ban.

## Rule Adherence, Feedback, and Disputes
Constructive feedback is welcomed in our Discord server. Disputes regarding post removals or account bans should also be addressed there. Any attempt to circumvent moderator actions on your account will lead to additional measures taken against it.
