Welcome to Metafy. Please familiarize yourself with our community guidelines, as they are essential for creating a positive and enjoyable experience for all members.

## Respect and Inclusivity

Respect is at the core of Metafy. We are committed to fostering a community where everyone feels welcome. We will not tolerate any form of harassment, threats, doxxing, or hate speech. This includes hate speech targeting individuals or groups based on their identity or vulnerability. Our goal is to ensure that everyone can engage with their interests in a safe and supportive environment.

## Content Standards Hello

Maintaining a welcoming environment includes keeping explicit content at bay. Refrain from posting sexually explicit content, and do not share or promote content that is sexually suggestive involving minors or content that depicts or seeks to normalize sexual abuse of any kind.

## Legal Compliance

Put simply: Don't break the law.

## Preserving the Browsing Experience

Quality and authenticity are key to our community's success. To ensure this, do not engage in activities that negatively impact the browsing experience of others. This includes, but is not limited to, spamming, spreading false or misleading information, or impersonating Metafy or other users. In addition, we reserve the right to remove content we deem to be especially low-effort or low-quality.

## Compliance with Enforcement

We prioritize a proactive enforcement approach, which includes warnings, post-removals, and account suspensions. In severe cases, we reserve the right to issue permanent bans without warning, particularly in situations that pose a significant threat to the community's well-being. Please respect the enforcement methods employed by Metafy and do not attempt to circumvent temporary or permanent disciplinary actions against your account. We value fairness and transparency in our enforcement efforts, and any attempts to subvert these measures will not be tolerated.

Our community guidelines are dynamic and will evolve as our features and community culture grow. Major changes will be announced, but we encourage you to revisit these guidelines regularly to stay informed.

Thank you for taking the time to read and understand our guidelines. We look forward to building an engaging and inclusive community with your help and collaboration.
